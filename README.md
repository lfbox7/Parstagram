### Notes
I tried to make the app look as close to Instagram, but I made some 'styling' mistakes that did not allow me to finish 'posting comments'. I think it is an easy fix... Profile photos have not been added, there is a profile page that needs to be completed, code is set for displaying for posts... not yet for comments. Look forward to continuing work throughout the next week to complete the project and add more bells and whistles.
